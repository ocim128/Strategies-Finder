# Repository Maintenance Log

Newest entry first. Keep completed improvements concise; record the evidence,
focused checks, and any useful follow-up so future maintenance runs can avoid
repeating the same investigation.

## 2026-10-01 - Restore test TypeScript check

- **Evidence:** `npm run typecheck:tests` failed with 134 diagnostics. 126 came
  from a stale smoke spec importing pruned strategies; the rest were confined
  to four specs with narrow type and import errors. Current strategy
  normalization and registration coverage is manifest-driven.
- **Change:** Removed the obsolete synthetic-ratio smoke spec and repaired the
  remaining fixtures/imports so test TypeScript checking covers the current
  library and compiles cleanly.
- **Checks:** `npm run typecheck`, `npm run typecheck:tests`, six focused specs,
  and `git diff --check` pass. The OPEN_SCORE replay specs also passed in the
  same maintenance run.
- **Follow-up:** Run the full suite at the next integration checkpoint; this
  pass kept runtime tests focused on the changed contracts.

## 2026-10-01 — Make OPEN_SCORE candidate selection cancellable

- **Evidence:** Artifact scanning, event sweeping, target evaluation, and the
  asset-switch simulator all observe Stop. Candidate construction in
  `candidate-selection.ts` did not, so both replay modes could continue through
  the full event set after a Stop request.
- **Change:** Candidate construction now checks Stop at event boundaries and
  after its bounded yields; cancellation discards partial selections and skips
  target-data loading.
- **Checks:** Both focused specs pass; `npm run typecheck` and `git diff --check`
  pass. `npm run typecheck:tests` reports errors in unrelated test files; a
  filtered compiler run reported no errors in the changed specs.
- **Follow-up:** The test typecheck failures recorded here were resolved in the
  maintenance entry above.
