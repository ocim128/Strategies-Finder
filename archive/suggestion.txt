New Strategy Lib Concepts (Finder-friendly)

regime_donchian_breakout
Logic: trade 55-bar breakout only when trend is positive and volatility is not extreme.
Exit: 20-bar channel exit + ATR trail + time stop.
Params (7): breakoutLen, exitLen, trendLen, volLen, volMinPct, volMaxPct, maxHoldBars.
Why robust: broad structural edge, few thresholds, no tiny TP tricks.
vol_compression_expansion
Logic: detect ATR compression, enter on range expansion in trend direction.
Exit: volatility fades or ATR trail hit.
Params (7): compressionLen, compressionPct, rangeLen, breakoutAtrBuffer, trendLen, trailAtr, maxHoldBars.
Why robust: regime transition model (quiet -> expansion), usually transferable.
shock_reversion_trend_gate
Logic: buy shock-down events only if long-term trend is up and vol spike confirms panic.
Exit: mean reversion target or time stop.
Params (7): shockLookback, shockZ, trendLen, volSpikePct, reversionLen, stopAtr, maxHoldBars.
Why robust: avoids blind dip-buying; entries only in controlled context.
dual_horizon_momentum_guard
Logic: require both fast and slow momentum alignment; go defensive on vol spike + momentum decay.
Exit: momentum breakdown.
Params (6): fastMomLen, slowMomLen, fastMomThr, slowMomThr, volSpikePct, cooldownBars.
Why robust: fewer discrete events, smoother behavior.
Rules for all new libs

Keep tunables at <= 8.
Avoid tiny fixed TP/SL as primary edge.
Use walkForwardParams allowlist to limit optimization scope.
Force entry/exit confirmation bars and time stops.
Rank by OOS durability first, not in-sample profit.
Deployment gate (minimum)

OOS durability score >= 55.
OOS PF >= 1.15.
OOS net profit % > 0.
OOS max DD under your risk cap.
Passes both normal and quick walk-forward without collapse.
