Buy long time frame RSI<30 events on high performing stocks and sell at 3% take profit. I built an algo alert system that does this and it’s free of charge for anyone who wants to use it. RSI<30 on a long time frame only occurs 10-15 times per stock on average.

The Momentum Effect states that stocks that outperform in 6-12 months will out perform in the next 1 - 3 months. The algo updates the list of stocks based on that Momentum Effect moving window, filtering on stocks that perform 25% in past 3 months, 45% in past 6 months and 75% in past 12 months. Stocks must achieve at least one of these then get ranked based on how many they achieve and the size of each gain. The current list, 93 stocks achieve all 3, the next 45 met 2.

The 3% TP doesn’t seem like much but the system alerts on up to 2000 events a year. And gaining just 3% after oversold for high performing stock is easy. Imagine compounding your $$ even 100 times in a year at 3%, that’s an effective gain of 1,822%.

The current win rate is 86%

============================
How long is long time frame?

It's definitely not intraday RSI. If you open a chart to 12 months, overlay RSI(14) with 5 minute candles you'll see RSI<30 crosses happen roughly 10 - 15 times per stock. The data base has over 50 million candles so we can calculate performance on stocks for Universe inclusion then track RSI oversold events on the 100 - 200 stocks in the Universe which is updated every 2-4 weeks. That's our Ram Jet channel. The Big Dipper channel is a smart DCA strategy for high performing ETF.

For Ram Jet we track RSI events for those roughly 100 - 200 stocks (the current universe is 153). Each stock experiences roughly 10 - 15 RSI<30 oversold events every year. With 153 stocks that's up to 2,295 events which you can take advantage of for compounding. Even if you only trade 100 of the events per lot, imagine compounding that lot 3% x 100 times a year, essentially 1,822% annually.
=============================
Win rate is 86%. 3% TP is the exit criteria or max hold 10 days.

==================================

Interesting. Where did you see the hedge against the momentum effect or overlaying the 5-minute RSI on a 12-month chart?

Hmm. Not sure I understand the question. I don't hedge against the momentum effect, I ride it. It's just a way to pick stocks with the highest probability of rising the fastest after an oversold event. I use Stock Charts and I trade on 2 min candles for granularity. What I've noticed is when I'm on a 12 month charting using 2 min candles up to 1 hour candles the RSI is the same. So my 12 month chart on Stock Charts is actually built on 1 hour candles. I developed a method on my own to use a 1 hour polling time frame for RSI, but because I'm using 5 min candles, I can get a calculation that detects intraday dips within 5 min. If I strictly policed every hour, I would miss a lot of price action. I could essentially move to 2 min or 1 min candles and be even more accurate. That's coming later but, for now, I've already downloaded 40 million candles to accomplish this, 1 min candles would require 200 million candles. Not sure my database is ready for that yet, nor my pocketbook.
==================================

Which of the 100+ stocks do you actually trade ?


The list of stock is updated every 2-4 weeks. The system allows us to filter based on market cap first so we’re primarily dealing with companies that more likely have good revenue and profits. From there we download candles for 12 months and filter on performance. Our current universe filters on 45%, 65% and 75% gain performance for 3, 6, and 12 months respectively. To make the list a stock has to meet at least one of these but we rank them and most of the stocks meet all three and the rest 2 of the criteria.
===================================
I've been investing since the 90's, Swing trading since 2000, and day trading since 2017. I blended the strategies into a swing trading, scalping strategy for revenue and DCA in to ETF and Big / Mega caps for long term hold with DCA. The foundation for all this is RSI<30 events which I then add a rating for each of the stock that experience an RSI<30 cross over. I rate the stocks based on a weighting of performance gain, mean reversion, consensus price target distance, beta, PEG and price. The backtesting performs consistently above 100% over 12 months.

I like the idea of using an algo system to create alerts because a computer can track many more things than a human. However, I still believe a human can still trade better than a computer so I don't automate my trades, but instead consider each alert and only trade some of them. This allows me to choose the best entry point, waiting for dips on my charts. For example, if the VIX is high, I will usually wait until the end of the day to buy since most stocks will continue to decline. If the VIX is high enough, I'll wait a day before I buy.

I can also choose when to exit. I always set a small % sell limit, but may choose to exit earlier or sometimes later. My strategy takes advantage of compounding events so I don't mind earning a small gain on each trade, but do it over and over again. With an automated alert system, the algo handles the time consuming part and I can concentrate on making the trade.

I use API's to collect price information on a few thousand stocks which I then manipulate to calculate stock performance and calculate mean reversion. I also use the API's to get price targets analyst ratings, PEG Ratio, beta, and volume. I use all of the information to rate each stock each time an alert is created so all the data is fresh and timely. The rating lets me know which stocks might do better than others.

I made a change to the system for a more accurate RSI Crossover threshold the beginning of December and forward testing (paper) achieved ~16%.

I started trading my alerts mid-November and have gained 82%. I started out with smaller lots and slowly worked my way up to $5000 per trade.

The system calculates a rating for each stock using Performance (Gain%), PEG Ratio, Mean Reversion Distance, Consensus Price Target distance, Beta, Volume, and Price (lower priced stocks can reach 3% faster). They only need to post a 3% gain to close. Out of 222 events only 27 were traded - that's only 1 trade every 11 days. In forward, real trading, sure, very hard to achieve 100% close rate, but the close rate is still very high. In my forward trading I'm at slightly higher than a 90% close rate.
==========================
The system I developed creates the alerts. It downloads 5 min candles using an API with AlphaVantage, downloads stock info from the SEC, and VIX info from indices-API.

I change my list of stocks every couple of weeks because the info is always changing. I rerun the picker with different criteria taking in to consideration market trends and most weight is placed on recent performance 3 months or less. After the list of stocks is created, the system downloads price data for each stock in the list daily - 5 min candles. The system also checks up to date info for a stock when it is alerted. It checks analyst ratings, distance from price target, distance from mean reversion, PEG ratio, volume, beta, along with the performance data to calculate a score. Each alerted stock is given a rating that predicts it ability to post at least 3% gain from an oversold condition.
===========================
You have to couple trading strategy with specific stocks. The best strategy in bad stocks will fail.

This is why my algo service tracks and finds the best out performers of the past 6-12 months. The momentum effect states that stocks that perform well in 6-12 months continue to perform well in the next 1-3. The system rebuilds the list of stocks every 2-4 weeks.

The stocks perform at 45%, 65%, and 75% for 3, 6, and 12 months.

The system alerts when the list of stocks which is usually between 100 and 200 stocks reaches RSI<30 for a long timeframe, not intraday timeframe.

Set a TP sell limit for 3%.

The system sends roughly 2,000 alerts in a year. Imagine compounding at 3% hundreds of times a year. 3% is easily reached.
